This is a Pomodoro app created with Flutter.
Please visit the app to test out on the top-right side. (pomodoro-flutter.vercel.app)

If you choose the play button, it runs for the chosen minutes (15/20/25/30/35) and gives you a 5-minute break.
After the break, it will start a new round after adding the number of round on the bottom.
Once it hits 4, the number of goals will be increased and the one of round will be reset to 0.

Thank you.
